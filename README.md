# Master of Magic

This repository provides a local development instructions for the **Master of Magic WordPress theme and plugins** using Docker. The setup is based on the [WordPress Dev Setup](https://github.com/PetyaFerreiraDeveloper/wordpress-docker-setup) created by Zarko Djuric.

You are not required to use Docker for local development of this project. If you prefer to use a different solution (eg. Local by Flywheel, DevKinsta, XAMPP / MAMP / WAMP ) you can skip this README and just use themes/plugins directly:

- Master of magic theme contains a separate README.md file in the theme folder
- Master of magic blocks plugin contains a separate README.md file in the plugin folder paychex-blocks
